AISG Student Hackathon 2021 - AutoAttend Submission


## Overview
AutoAttend is a submission for the AISG Student Hackathon 2021, and it uses the AISG [PeekingDuck](https://github.com/aimakerspace/PeekingDuck) CV brick. The idea of this project is to have a teacher submit a picture of the classroom. The system will then recognise the face and then record down their presence in the classroom in a MongoDB database.
